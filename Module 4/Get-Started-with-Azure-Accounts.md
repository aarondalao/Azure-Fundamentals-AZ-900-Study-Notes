- To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription. 
- When you're completing Learn modules, most of the time a temporary subscription is created for you, which runs in an environment called the Learn sandbox. 
- When you're working with your own applications and business needs, you need to create an Azure account, and a subscription will be created for you. 
- After you've created an Azure account, you're free to create additional subscriptions. 
- For example, your company might use a single Azure account for your business and separate subscriptions for development, marketing, and sales departments. 
- After you've created an Azure subscription, you can start creating Azure resources within each subscription.

## Create an Azure account

You can purchase Azure access directly from Microsoft by signing up on the Azure website or through a Microsoft representative. You can also purchase Azure access through a Microsoft partner. Cloud Solution Provider partners offer a range of complete managed-cloud solutions for Azure.

### What is the Microsoft Learn sandbox?

Many of the Learn exercises use a technology called the sandbox, which creates a temporary subscription that's added to your Azure account. This temporary subscription allows you to create Azure resources during a Learn module. Learn automatically cleans up the temporary resources for you after you've completed the module.

When you're completing a Learn module, you're welcome to use your personal subscription to complete the exercises in a module. However, the sandbox is the preferred method to use because it allows you to create and test Azure resources at no cost to you.
