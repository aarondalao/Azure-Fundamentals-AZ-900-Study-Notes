❗❗❗***Note:***   ==**very important concept**== | #WIP 

The Azure Well-Architected Framework is a design framework that can improve the quality of a workload by helping it to:

- Be resilient, available, and recoverable.
- Be as secure as you need it to be.
- Deliver a sufficient return on investment.
- Support responsible development and operations.
- Accomplish its purpose within acceptable timeframes.

The framework is founded on the five pillars of architectural excellence, which are mapped to those goals. They are: [**Reliability**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/reliability/), [**Security**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/security/), [**Cost Optimization**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/), [**Operational Excellence**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/), and [**Performance Efficiency**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/performance-efficiency/).

Each pillar provides recommended practices, risk considerations, and tradeoffs. The design decisions must be balanced across all pillars, given the business requirements. The technical and actionable guidance is broad enough for all workloads and applies to a specific scenario. This guidance is centered on Azure.

Workload architecture isn't the same as its implementation. The Well-Architected Framework can set you up for success through architectural design, but the implementation choices depend on the business requirements and constraints of your organization.
