Reliability and predictability are two crucial cloud benefits that help you develop solutions with confidence.

## Reliability 
- the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. It is also one of the pillars of the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](Microsoft-Azure-Well-Architected-Framework.md).
- The cloud, by virtue of its decentralized design, naturally supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure.  With this global scale, even if one region has a catastrophic event other regions are still up and running.
- Design your apps to automatically take advantage of this increased reliability.
- In some cases, your cloud environment itself will automatically shift to a different region for you, with no action needed on your part.
- You’ll learn more about how Azure leverages global scale to provide reliability later in this series.

## Predictability
- this lets you move forward with confidence.
- can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability
	- Both performance and cost predictability are heavily influenced by [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](Microsoft-Azure-Well-Architected-Framework.md).
- Deploy a solution that's built around this framework and you have a solution whose cost and performance are predictable.

## Performance Predictability
- focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers.
- Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.
- If you suddenly need more resources, autoscaling can deploy additional resources to meet the demand, and then scale back when the demand drops.
- if the traffic is heavily focused on one area, load balancing will help redirect some of the overload to less stressed areas.

## Cost Predictability
- Focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. 
- you can track your resource in real time, monitor resources that you're using them in the most efficient way, and apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments
- By operating in the cloud and using cloud analytics and information, you can predict future costs and adjust your resources as needed.
- You can even use tools like the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.
