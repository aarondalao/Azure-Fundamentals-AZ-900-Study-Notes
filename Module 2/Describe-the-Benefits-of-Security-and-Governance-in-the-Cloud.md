## Governance
- Whether you're deploying IaaS or SaaS, cloud features support governance and compliance
- Set templates help ensure that all your deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements
- You can update all your deployed resources to new standards as standards change.
- Cloud-based auditing helps flag any resource that's out of compliance with your corporate standards and provides mitigation strategies. 
- Depending on your operating model, software patches and updates may also automatically be applied, which helps with both governance and security.
- By establishing a good governance footprint early, you can keep your cloud footprint updated, secure, and well managed.
## Security
- find a cloud solution that matches your security needs.
- If you want maximum control of security, IaaS provides your with physical resources but lets you manage the operating systems and installed software, including patches and maintenance.
- If you want patches and maintenance taken care of automatically, PaaS or SaaS may be the best cloud strategies for you.
- And Because the cloud is intended as an over-the-internet Delivery of IT Resources, Cloud Providers are typically well suited to handle things like [Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ddos-protection/ddos-protection-overview), making your network more robust and secure.
