## Define cloud models
- This defines the deployment type of cloud resources. There are three main cloud models:
### Private Cloud
- A private cloud is, in some ways, the natural evolution from a corporate datacenter.
- it is a cloud (delivering IT services over the internet) that's used by a single entity.
- provides much greater control for the company and its IT department.
- Greater cost and fewer benefits of a public cloud deployment
- may hosted from your on site datacenter, may also be ho9sted in a dedicated datacenter offsite, potentially even by a third party that has dedicated that datacenter to your company.
### Public Cloud
- Built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider.
- anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources.
- The general public availability is a key difference between public and private cloud

### Hybrid Cloud
- a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. 
- can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. 
- can be used to provide an extra layer of security

The following table highlights a few key comparative aspects between the cloud models:

| **Public cloud**                                                      | **Private cloud**                                                  | **Hybrid cloud**                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No capital expenditures to scale up                                   | Organizations have complete control over resources and security    | Provides the most flexibility                                     |
| Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned             | Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data              | Organizations determine where to run their applications           |
| Organizations pay only for what they use                              | Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance             | Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements |
| Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security | Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates |                                                                   |
### Optional: Multi-Cloud
- an increasingly likely scenario
- you use multiple public cloud providers
- or maybe you use different features from different cloud providers
- or maybe you star4ted your cloud journey with on provider and are in the process of migrating to a different provider.
- regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers and manage resources and security in both environments.

### [Azure Arc ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/azure-arc#:~:text=Azure%20Arc%20is%20a%20bridge,%2C%20operations%2C%20and%20security%20model.)
- it is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment.
- can help manage your cloud environment, whenever it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid config, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.

### [Azure VMWare Solution](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/azure-vmware#:~:text=Seamlessly%move%VMware-based%workloads%from,%that&runs%on%Azure%infrastructure.)
- What if you're already established with VMWare in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? 
- Azure VMWare Solution lets you run your VMWare workloads in Azure with seamless integration and Scalability
