## Describe the Consumption-Based Model

There are **two types of expenses** to consider when comparing IT Infrastructure Models:
- Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
	- A One-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources.
	- A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.
- Operational Expenditures (OpEx)
	- Spending money on services or products over time.
	- Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services.

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model.
- You don't pay for the physical infrastructure and the underlying operational costs of owning a datacenter (Electricity, Security, Etc).
- Only pay for the IT resource you use. If you don't use any IT Resources this month, you don't pay for any IT resources.

Benefits of consumption-based model:
- No Upfront costs
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential
- The ability to **pay** for some **more resources** when **they are needed**.
- The ability to **stop paying** for resources that are **no longer needed**.

With traditional Datacenters, you try to estimate the future resource needs
- If you overestimate, you spend more on your datacenter than you need to and potentially waste money.
- If you underestimate, your datacenter will quickly reach capacity and your applications and services may suffer from decreased performance.
- Fixing an under-provisioned datacenter can take a long time. You man need to order, receive, and install more hardware, or add more power, cooling, and networking for the extra hardware.

In a Cloud-based model, you don't have to working about getting the resources needs just right. 
- if you find that you need more virtual machines, you add more
- if the demand drops and you don't need as many virtual machines, you can remove it on the fly.
- either way, you're only paying for the VM's that you use, not the "extra capacity" that the cloud provider has on hand.
### Compare Cloud pricing models

- is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
- You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, which helps you:
	- Plan and manage your operating costs
	- Run Infrastructure more efficiently
	- Scale as your business needs change
