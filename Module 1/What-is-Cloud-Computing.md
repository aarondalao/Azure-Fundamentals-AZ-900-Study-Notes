## What is Cloud computing
 - it is the delivery of computing services over the internet.  
 - Computing services include common IT infrastructure such as virtual machines, databases, and networking.  
 - Cloud Services also expand the traditional IT offerings to include things like Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
 - It is not constrained by a physical infrastructure the same way that a traditional datacenter is. 
 - That means if you need to increase your IT infrastructure rapidly, you don't have to wait to build a new datacenter, 
 - you can use the cloud to rapidly expand your IT footprint.
