In this module, you learned about general cloud concepts. You started with things like just understanding what cloud computing is. You also learned about the shared responsibility model and how you and your cloud provider share the responsibility of keeping your information in the cloud secure. You briefly covered the differences between the cloud models (public, private, hybrid, and multi-cloud). Then, you wrapped up with a unit on how the cloud shifts IT spend from a capital expense to an operational expense.

## Learning objectives

- Define cloud computing.
- Describe the shared responsibility model.
- Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.
- Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model.
- Describe the consumption-based model.
