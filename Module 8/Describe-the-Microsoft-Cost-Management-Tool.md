Microsoft Azure is a global cloud provider, meaning you can provision resources anywhere in the world. You can provision resources rapidly to meet a sudden demand, or to test out a new feature, or on accident. If you accidentally provision new resources, you may not be aware of them until itâ€™s time for your invoice. Cost Management is a service that helps avoid those situations.

## What is Cost Management?

- It provides the ability to <mark>quickly check Azure resource costs, create alerts based on resource spend, and create budgets that can be used to automate management of resources</mark>.
- **Cost analysis** is a subset of Cost Management that provides a quick visual for your Azure costs. -
	- Using cost analysis, you can <mark>quickly view the total cost in a variety of different ways, including by billing cycle, region, resource, and so on.</mark>
	- You use cost analysis to explore and analyze your organizational costs. 
	- You can view aggregated costs by organization to understand where costs are accrued and to identify spending trends. 
	- And you can see accumulated costs over time to estimate monthly, quarterly, or even yearly cost trends against a budget.

## Cost alerts

- It provide a <mark>single location to quickly check on all of the different alert types that may show up in the Cost Management service. </mark>The three types of alerts that may show up are:
	- Budget alerts
	- Credit alerts
	- Department spending quota alerts.

### Budget alerts

- <mark>notify you</mark> when spending, based on usage or cost, <mark>reaches or exceeds the amount defined in the alert condition of the budget.</mark> 
- Cost Management budgets are created using the Azure portal or the Azure Consumption API.
	- In the Azure portal, budgets are defined by cost. 
	- Budgets are defined by cost or by consumption usage when using the Azure Consumption API. 
	- Budget alerts support both cost-based and usage-based budgets. 
	- Budget alerts are generated automatically whenever the budget alert conditions are met. 
	- You can view all cost alerts in the Azure portal. Whenever an alert is generated, it appears in cost alerts. 
	- An alert email is also sent to the people in the alert recipients list of the budget.

### Credit alerts

- <mark>It notifies you when your Azure credit monetary commitments are consumed. </mark>
	- Monetary commitments are for organizations with Enterprise Agreements (EAs). 
	- Credit alerts are generated automatically at 90% and at 100% of your Azure credit balance. 
	- Whenever an alert is generated, it's reflected in cost alerts, and in the email sent to the account owners.

### Department spending quota alerts

- Department spending quota alerts notify you when department spending reaches a fixed threshold of the quota. 
	- Spending quotas are configured in the EA portal. 
	- Whenever a threshold is met, it generates an email to department owners, and appears in cost alerts. For example, 50 percent or 75 percent of the quota.

## Budgets

- A budget is where you <mark>set a spending limit for Azure.</mark>
	- You can set budgets based on a subscription, resource group, service type, or other criteria. 
	- When you set a budget, you will also set a budget alert.
	- When the budget hits the budget alert level, it will trigger a budget alert that shows up in the cost alerts area. 
	- If configured, budget alerts will also send an email notification that a budget alert threshold has been triggered.
- A more advanced use of budgets enables budget conditions to trigger automation that suspends or otherwise modifies resources once the trigger condition has occurred.
