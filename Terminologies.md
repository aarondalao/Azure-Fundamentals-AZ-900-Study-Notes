#### API 
- Application Programming Interface
- is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. 
- Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. 
- Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.
- A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.
#### CLI
- Command Line Interface
- is a text-based interface where you can input commands that interact with a computer's operating system.
#### VM
- Virtual Machine
- is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps. 
- One or more virtual “guest” machines run on a physical “host” machine.  
- Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host. 
- This means that, for example, a virtual MacOS virtual machine can run on a physical PC.
#### Virtualization
- Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based, or "virtual" version of a computer, with dedicated amounts of CPU, memory, and storage that are "borrowed" from a physical host computer—such as your personal computer— and/or a remote server—such as a server in a cloud provider's datacenter.

#### REST
- Representational State Transfer
- describes the general rules for how the data and services are represented through the API so that other programs will be able to correctly request and receive the data and services that an API makes available

#### CI/CD
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
- [Continuous integration](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration?cicd=32h281b "Red Hat | Understanding enterprise integration") (CI) refers to the practice of [automatically](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation?cicd=32h281b "Understanding automation") and frequently integrating code changes into a shared source code repository. [Continuous delivery](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-continuous-delivery?cicd=32h281b "What is continuous delivery?") and/or deployment (CD) is a 2 part process that refers to the integration, testing, and delivery of code changes. 
- Continuous delivery stops short of automatic production deployment, while continuous deployment automatically releases the updates into the production environment.

#### DevOps
- Development Operations
- DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes. A more nimble software development lifecycle results in a competitive advantage for businesses and their customers.

#### Repo
- Repository
- contains all of your code, your files, and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your work within the repository.
