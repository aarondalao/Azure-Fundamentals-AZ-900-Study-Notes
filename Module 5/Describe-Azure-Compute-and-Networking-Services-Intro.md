In this module, you’ll be introduced to the compute and networking services of Azure. You’ll learn about three of the compute options (virtual machines, containers, and Azure functions). You’ll also learn about some of the networking features, such as Azure virtual networks, Azure DNS, and Azure ExpressRoute.

## Learning objectives

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- Compare compute types, including container instances, virtual machines, and functions.
- Describe virtual machine options, including virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets, virtual machine availability sets, and Azure Virtual Desktop.
- Describe resources required for virtual machines.
- Describe application hosting options, including Azure Web Apps, containers, and virtual machines.
