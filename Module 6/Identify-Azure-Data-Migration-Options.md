Now that you understand the different storage options within Azure, it’s important to also understand how to get your data and information into Azure. Azure supports both real-time migration of infrastructure, applications, and data using Azure Migrate as well as asynchronous migration of data using Azure Data Box.

## Azure Migrate

- <mark>It is a service that helps you migrate from an on-premises environment to the cloud. </mark>
- Azure Migrate functions as a hub to help you manage the assessment and migration of your on-premises datacenter to Azure. It provides the following:
	- **Unified migration platform**: 
		- <mark>A single portal to start, run, and track your migration to Azure.</mark>
	- **Range of tools**: 
		- A range of tools for assessment and migration. 
		- Azure Migrate tools include <mark><b>Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment </b>and <b>Azure Migrate: Server Migration.</b></mark> Azure Migrate also integrates with other Azure services and tools, and with independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.
	- **Assessment and migration**: 
		- In the Azure Migrate hub, you can<mark> assess and migrate your on-premises infrastructure to Azure.</mark>

### Integrated tools

- In addition to working with tools from ISVs, the Azure Migrate hub also includes the following tools to help with migration:
	- **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment**. 
		- Discover and assess on-premises servers running on VMware, Hyper-V, and physical servers in preparation for migration to Azure.
	- **Azure Migrate: Server Migration**. 
		- Migrate VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, physical servers, other virtualized servers, and public cloud VMs to Azure.
	- **Data Migration Assistant**. 
		- Data Migration Assistant is a stand-alone tool to assess SQL Servers. 
		- It helps pinpoint potential problems blocking migration. 
		- It identifies unsupported features, new features that can benefit you after migration, and the right path for database migration.
	- **Azure Database Migration Service**. 
		- Migrate on-premises databases to Azure VMs running SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or SQL Managed Instances.
	- **Azure App Service migration assistant**. 
		- Azure App Service migration assistant is a standalone tool to assess on-premises websites for migration to Azure App Service. Use Migration Assistant to migrate .NET and PHP web apps to Azure.
	- **Azure Data Box**. 
		- Use Azure Data Box products to move large amounts of offline data to Azure.

## Azure Data Box

- <mark>It is a physical migration service that helps transfer large amounts of data in a quick, inexpensive, and reliable way.</mark>
- The secure data transfer is accelerated by shipping you a proprietary Data Box storage device that has a maximum usable storage capacity of 80 terabytes. 
- The Data Box is transported to and from your datacenter via a regional carrier. A rugged case protects and secures the Data Box from damage during transit.
- You can order the Data Box device via the Azure portal to import or export data from Azure. 
	- Once the device is received, you can quickly set it up using the local web UI and connect it to your network. 
	- Once you’re finished transferring the data (either into or out of Azure), simply return the Data Box.
	- If you’re transferring data into Azure, the data is automatically uploaded once Microsoft receives the Data Box back.
	- The entire process is tracked end-to-end by the Data Box service in the Azure portal.

### Use cases

- Data Box is ideally suited to transfer data sizes larger than 40 TBs in scenarios with no to limited network connectivity. 
- The data movement can be one-time, periodic, or an initial bulk data transfer followed by periodic transfers.
- Here are the various scenarios where Data Box can be used to import data to Azure:
	- **Onetime migration** - when a large amount of on-premises data is moved to Azure.
	- Moving a media library from offline tapes into Azure to create an online media library.
	- Migrating your VM farm, SQL server, and applications to Azure.
	- Moving historical data to Azure for in-depth analysis and reporting using HDInsight.
	- **Initial bulk transfer** - when an initial bulk transfer is done using Data Box (seed) followed by incremental transfers over the network.
	- **Periodic uploads** - when large amount of data is generated periodically and needs to be moved to Azure.
- Here are the various scenarios where Data Box can be used to export data from Azure.

	- Disaster recovery 
		- when a copy of the data from Azure is restored to an on-premises network. 
		- In a typical disaster recovery scenario, a large amount of Azure data is exported to a Data Box. 
		- Microsoft then ships this Data Box, and the data is restored on your premises in a short time.
	- Security requirements 
		- when you need to be able to export data out of Azure due to government or security requirements.
	- Migrate back to on-premises or to another cloud service provider 
		- when you want to move all the data back to on-premises, or to another cloud service provider, export data via Data Box to migrate the workloads.
- Once the data from your import order is uploaded to Azure, the disks on the device are wiped clean in accordance with NIST 800-88r1 standards. 
- For an export order, the disks are erased once the device reaches the Azure datacenter.
