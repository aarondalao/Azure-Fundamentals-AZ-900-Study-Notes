## [Conditional Access ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/overview)
- it is a tool that [Microsoft Entra ID](terminologies#Microsoft-Entra-ID) uses to allow (or deny) access to resources based on identity signals. 
- These signals include who the user is, where the user is, and what device the user is requesting access from.
- Conditional Access helps IT administrators:
	- Empower users to be productive wherever and whenever.
	- Protect the organization's assets.
- It also provides a more granular multifactor authentication experience for users. 
	- For example, a user might not be challenged for second authentication factor if they're at a known location. 
	- However, they might be challenged for a second authentication factor if their sign-in signals are unusual or they're at an unexpected location.
	- During sign-in, Conditional Access collects signals from the user, makes decisions based on those signals, and then enforces that decision by allowing or denying the access request or challenging for a multifactor authentication response.

The following diagram illustrates this flow:

- Here, the signal might be the user's location, the user's device, or the application that the user is trying to access.
- Based on these signals, the decision might be to allow full access if the user is signing in from their usual location. 
- If the user is signing in from an unusual location or a location that's marked as high risk, then access might be blocked entirely or possibly granted after the user provides a second form of authentication.
- ***Enforcement*** is the action that carries out the decision. For example, the action is to allow access or require the user to provide a second form of authentication.

## When can I use [Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/overview)?

[Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/overview) is useful when you need to:
- Require [multifactor authentication (MFA)](terminologies#MFA) to access an application depending on the requesterâ€™s role, location, or network. For example, you could require MFA for administrators but not regular users or for people connecting from outside your corporate network.
- Require access to services only through approved client applications. For example, you could limit which email applications are able to connect to your email service.
- Require users to access your application only from managed devices. A managed device is a device that meets your standards for security and compliance.
- Block access from untrusted sources, such as access from unknown or unexpected locations.
