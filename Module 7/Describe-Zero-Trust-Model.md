### Zero Trust 
- is a <mark>security model that assumes the worst case scenario and protects resources with that expectation. </mark>
- Zero Trust assumes breach at the outset, and then verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network.
- Today, organizations need a new security model that effectively adapts to the complexity of the modern environment; embraces the mobile workforce: and protects people, devices, applications, and data wherever they're located.
- To address this new world of computing, Microsoft highly recommends the Zero Trust security model, which is based on these guiding principles:
	- **Verify explicitly** 
		- <mark>Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.</mark>
	- **Use least privilege access** 
		- <mark>Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.</mark>
	- **Assume breach** 
		- <mark>Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption. Use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.</mark>

## Adjusting to Zero Trust

- Traditionally, corporate networks were restricted, protected, and generally assumed safe. 
- Only managed computers could join the network, VPN access was tightly controlled, and personal devices were frequently restricted or blocked.
- The Zero Trust model flips that scenario. 
	- Instead of assuming that a device is safe because it’s within the corporate network, it requires everyone to authenticate. Then grants access based on authentication rather than location.
